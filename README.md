# Form-Validator

This project is like a smart assistant for a sign-up form on a website. It checks if you've filled in your name, phone, email, and password correctly. If your password is strong and both passwords match, it says you've signed up successfully. It also makes sure you don't forget anything. When you hit the "Register" button, it double-checks everything and tells you if something is missing or if your passwords don't match. If all is good, it pretends to send your info to a magical database (it just shows it on the computer screen for now). It's like a friendly helper making sure you enter the right things to join a website.
